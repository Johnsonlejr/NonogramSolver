# NonogramSolver
My senior project: A program to solve a nonogram, a Japanese logic puzzle

Opening the sln file in Visual Studio or another compatible software shoudl allow access to the project.

Start.cs: This is the beginning page of the solver, where the user is prompted to enter the number of rows and columns.
Clue Entry.cs: This is where the user is prompted to enter the clues for each row and column. The user can also load the last entered nonogram.
